# K-AI_Manufacturing
I participated in the 2021 K-Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Data Analysis Contest.  
Data was provided by kamp.  
The challenge was to come up with ideas that could improve the working environment of root companies and implement them into artificial intelligence algorithms.  
My team's goal was to predict the number of defective items.
